				<p>Math Farm is a gamified interactive math game built based on the presense of key game mechanics such Points, Badges, Leaderboards (<abbr title="Points, Badges, Leaderboards">PBLs</abbr>), and instant feedback.</p>
				<p>
					Math Farm provides many activities to help kids develop an active attitude towards study in general, and math in particular, and to achieve a particualr learning goal designed by gamification designer while playing the activties.

				<p>
					Gamification is not only a simple set of techniques and mechanics, but also “an alternative framework for training and shaping participant behaviour that has at its core the concepts of entertainment and engagement” (Tulloch, 2014). The reason gamification can match with pedagogy is that there are some similarities between games and study. The structure of similarities (inherited from Herger, 2014) below shows how Math Farm uses gamification techniques to develop study activities that provide gameful experience.

					<h2>Gameplay</h2>
					<p>Players begin with an empty farm and a fixed starting number of coins which are the primary
						currency in the game.</p>
					<p>Players move around the environment and attack enemies to collect coins and experience
	points (XP). An attack is considered successful when players give a correct answer to a math
	question. When an attack is successful, the player earn coins and XP described in enemy’s
	detail. There is no penalty for wrong answer. If a player is unable to answer a question, they
						can use related instructions as a hint to solve the question without penalty.</p>
					<p>XP is used for level up. When players reach a certain level, they will choose a fixed title from
	the title list. If a player owns a title, the gamification master must call the player by their title
	instead of their real name. Players will be ranked in a leader board based on their XP. Players
	also achieve badges when they complete some specific tasks. Badges may reward coins and
	XP.
					</p>
					<p>Players can use coins to buy items which are images of houses, decorations, trees, pets, etc. to
	design their farm. The best farm will be selected by a vote from all participants at the end of
	the semester. The winner will be listed in the Hall of Fame. Coins are also used to exchange
	action cards. The person who owns an action card can request another person to perform the
	action described in the card. Cards may or may not have rewards. Furthermore, players can
	exchange coins for a custom title. The cost for custom title depends on its length followed by
						the list below;</p>
					<div class="table-responsive">									
						<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
							<caption>Table 2: Custom title exchange rate</caption>

									<td>80</td>
									<td>40 coins/word</td>

								<tr>
									<td>3 word title</td>
									<td>90</td>
									<td>30 coins/word</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>4 word title</td>
									<td>100</td>
									<td>25 coins/word</td>

									<td>5 word title</td>
									<td>110</td>
									<td>22 coins/word</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
					</div>								
					<p>As the activity progresses, the difficulty of questions will be increased based on players’ level
	and skills. When the difficulty increases, the rewards increase as well. At the final session,
	time is required to answer a question.
					</p>
					<p>Different players may have different goals when they play. The list below is the possible
	goals from this activity:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Buy items for decorating player’s farm</li>
						<li>Collect badges/titles</li>
						<li>Buy action cards to interact with other players</li>
						<li>Maintain high rank in leader board (based on XP)</li>
						<li>Save coins as much as possible</li>
					</ul>
